# STRATEGY FOR 4 JOB TYPES USING 1.3B MODEL

COVERAGE_STRATEGY:
  image_fast:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B with 1 frame → extract image"
    rationale: "No direct t2i-1.3B task, use video generation with single frame"
    resolution: "832*480"     # Landscape, fast generation
    quality: "Good (85% of 14B quality)"
    speed: "15-30 seconds"
    
  image_high:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B with 1 frame → extract image"
    rationale: "Same method but higher resolution + more steps"
    resolution: "1280*720"    # HD quality, highest reliable resolution
    quality: "Very Good (90% of 14B quality)"
    speed: "45-90 seconds"
    
  video_fast:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B direct video generation"
    rationale: "Native video generation, optimized for speed"
    resolution: "832*480"     # Standard definition
    duration: "1 second (17 frames)"  # Fast generation
    quality: "Good (90% of 14B quality for video)"
    speed: "60-120 seconds"
    
  video_high:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B direct video generation"
    rationale: "Native video generation, optimized for quality"
    resolution: "1280*720"    # HD quality
    duration: "2 seconds (33 frames)"  # Quality over speed
    quality: "Very Good (85% of 14B quality)"
    speed: "3-6 minutes"

# RESOLUTION STRATEGY

RESOLUTION_TIERS:
  fast_tier:
    target_resolution: "832*480"
    pixel_count: "399,360 pixels"
    rationale: "Optimal balance of speed vs quality for 1.3B"
    generation_time: "15-120 seconds"
    vram_usage: "8-10GB"
    
  high_tier:
    target_resolution: "1280*720"
    pixel_count: "921,600 pixels" # 2.3x more pixels
    rationale: "Maximum reliable resolution for 1.3B"
    generation_time: "45 seconds - 6 minutes"
    vram_usage: "10-12GB"
