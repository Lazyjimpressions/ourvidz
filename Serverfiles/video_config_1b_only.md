# WAN 2.1 1.3B MODEL CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS - UPDATED

MODEL_SPECIFICATIONS:
  wan_2_1_1_3b:
    tasks: ["t2v-1.3B"]  # Primary: video generation (can extract single frame for images)
    vram_usage: "8.2GB peak"
    supported_sizes: ["640*480", "832*480", "480*640"]
    recommended_resolution: "640*480"  # Most stable for 1.3B variant
    max_stable_resolution: "832*480"   # Wide format, some success but less consistent
    frame_limits: "1-81 frames"        # 1 frame = image, up to 5 seconds video @ 16fps
    fps: "16"                          # Standard frame rate
    duration_limit: "5 seconds max"    # Realistic cap for 1.3B model

# STRATEGY FOR 4 JOB TYPES USING 1.3B MODEL

COVERAGE_STRATEGY:
  image_fast:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B with 1 frame → extract first frame as image"
    rationale: "Single frame generation using video pipeline"
    resolution: "640*480"     # Most stable resolution
    quality: "Good (85% of theoretical 14B quality)"
    speed: "15-30 seconds"
    use_case: "Quick previews, thumbnails, storyboarding"
    
  image_high:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B with 1 frame → extract first frame as image"
    rationale: "High-quality single frame with more inference steps"
    resolution: "832*480"     # Wide format for higher quality (less stable)
    quality: "Very Good (90% of theoretical 14B quality)"
    speed: "45-90 seconds"
    use_case: "Final images, character portraits, detailed stills"
    
  video_fast:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B direct video generation"
    rationale: "Native video generation optimized for speed"
    resolution: "640*480"     # Standard definition, most stable
    duration: "2.5 seconds (41 frames @ 16fps)"  # Balanced speed/quality
    quality: "Good (90% of theoretical 14B quality for video)"
    speed: "2-4 minutes"
    use_case: "Quick video previews, social media clips"
    
  video_high:
    approach: "t2v-1.3B direct video generation"
    rationale: "Native video generation optimized for quality"
    resolution: "640*480"     # Keep stable resolution even for high quality
    duration: "5 seconds (81 frames @ 16fps)"  # Maximum stable duration
    quality: "Very Good (85-90% of theoretical 14B quality)"
    speed: "4-8 minutes"
    use_case: "Final video content, longer clips"

# RESOLUTION STRATEGY - CORRECTED

RESOLUTION_TIERS:
  fast_tier:
    target_resolution: "640*480"
    pixel_count: "307,200 pixels"
    aspect_ratio: "4:3"
    rationale: "Most stable resolution for 1.3B, proven reliable"
    generation_time: "15 seconds - 4 minutes"
    vram_usage: "8-8.2GB"
    stability: "Excellent (99%+ success rate)"
    
  high_tier:
    target_resolution: "832*480"
    pixel_count: "399,360 pixels" # 30% more pixels than fast tier
    aspect_ratio: "16:9 (wide)"
    rationale: "Higher quality but less stable, use sparingly"
    generation_time: "45 seconds - 8 minutes"
    vram_usage: "8.2GB"
    stability: "Good (85-90% success rate)"
    notes: "Some inconsistency reported, fallback to 640x480 if fails"
