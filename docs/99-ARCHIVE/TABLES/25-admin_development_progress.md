## **Integration Map**
- **Pages/Components**
  - Admin Dashboard - Development progress monitoring
  - Project Management - Feature tracking and planning
  - Development Board - Kanban-style development tracking
- **Edge Functions**
  - system-metrics - Development progress aggregation

## **Business Rules**
- **Feature Tracking**: All development features are tracked with status and progress
- **Category Organization**: Features organized by categories for better management
- **Priority Management**: Features have priority levels for resource allocation
- **Time Tracking**: Estimated vs actual hours for project management
- **Status Management**: Features progress through different status stages
- **Blocker Tracking**: Development blockers are documented and tracked
- **Admin Access**: Only admins can view and manage development progress

ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get features by assignee
SELECT 
    assigned_to,
    COUNT(*) as total_features,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_features,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'in_progress') as in_progress_features,
    SUM(estimated_hours) as total_estimated_hours,
    SUM(actual_hours) as total_actual_hours
FROM admin_development_progress
WHERE assigned_to IS NOT NULL

-- Get high priority features
SELECT 
    feature_name,
    feature_category,
    status,

ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get development velocity
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as week,
    COUNT(*) as features_started,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as features_completed,
    SUM(estimated_hours) as estimated_hours,
    SUM(actual_hours) as actual_hours
FROM admin_development_progress
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 weeks'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at)
ORDER BY week DESC;

-- Get overdue features
SELECT 
    feature_name,
    feature_category,
    assigned_to,
    estimated_hours,
    actual_hours,
    start_date,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - start_date)) / 86400 as days_since_start
FROM admin_development_progress
WHERE status != 'completed'
  AND start_date IS NOT NULL
  AND start_date < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY days_since_start DESC;

-- Get feature completion trends
SELECT 
    feature_category,
    COUNT(*) as total_features,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_features,
    ROUND(
        (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed')::float / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2
    ) as completion_rate
FROM admin_development_progress
GROUP BY feature_category
ORDER BY completion_rate DESC;
```

## **Indexing Recommendations**
```sql
-- Primary indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_dev_progress_status ON admin_development_progress(status, priority DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_dev_progress_category ON admin_development_progress(feature_category, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_dev_progress_assignee ON admin_development_progress(assigned_to, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_dev_progress_priority ON admin_development_progress(priority DESC, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_dev_progress_dates ON admin_development_progress(start_date, completion_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_dev_progress_created ON admin_development_progress(created_at DESC);
```

## **Notes**
- **Project Management**: Comprehensive tracking of development features and progress
- **Time Tracking**: Monitors estimated vs actual development time
- **Status Management**: Features progress through different development stages
- **Blocker Management**: Documents and tracks development blockers
- **Resource Allocation**: Priority system helps with resource allocation
- **Category Organization**: Features organized by categories for better management
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks completion rates and development velocity
