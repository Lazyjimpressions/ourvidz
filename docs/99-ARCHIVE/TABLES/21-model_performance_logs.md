    AVG(avg_quality_rating) as avg_quality,
    AVG(
        (successful_generations::float / total_generations) * 100
    ) as avg_success_rate
FROM model_performance_logs
WHERE date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY model_type
ORDER BY avg_quality DESC;

-- Get performance anomalies (high failure rates)
SELECT 
    date,
    model_type,
    total_generations,
    failed_generations,
    ROUND(
        (failed_generations::float / total_generations) * 100, 2
    ) as failure_rate_percentage
FROM model_performance_logs
WHERE (failed_generations::float / total_generations) > 0.1
  AND date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY failure_rate_percentage DESC;

-- Get quality trends
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', date) as week,
    model_type,
    AVG(avg_quality_rating) as weekly_avg_quality,
    COUNT(*) as data_points
FROM model_performance_logs
WHERE date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 weeks'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('week', date), model_type
ORDER BY week DESC, weekly_avg_quality DESC;

-- Get processing time analysis
SELECT 
    model_type,
    AVG(avg_generation_time_ms) as avg_time_ms,
    MIN(avg_generation_time_ms) as min_time_ms,

FROM model_performance_logs
WHERE avg_generation_time_ms IS NOT NULL
  AND date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY model_type
ORDER BY avg_time_ms;

-- Get daily performance summary
SELECT 
    date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT model_type) as active_models,
    SUM(total_generations) as total_generations,
    SUM(successful_generations) as total_successful,
    AVG(avg_quality_rating) as overall_avg_quality
FROM model_performance_logs
WHERE date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

```

## **Indexing Recommendations**
```sql
-- Primary indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_model_performance_logs_model_date ON model_performance_logs(model_type, date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_model_performance_logs_date ON model_performance_logs(date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_model_performance_logs_quality ON model_performance_logs(avg_quality_rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_model_performance_logs_time ON model_performance_logs(avg_generation_time_ms);
```
