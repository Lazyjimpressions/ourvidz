CREATE INDEX idx_prompt_ab_tests_complete ON prompt_ab_tests(is_complete, quality_improvement DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_prompt_ab_tests_improvement ON prompt_ab_tests(quality_improvement DESC, confidence_level DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_prompt_ab_tests_created ON prompt_ab_tests(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_prompt_ab_tests_confidence ON prompt_ab_tests(confidence_level DESC, is_complete);
```
