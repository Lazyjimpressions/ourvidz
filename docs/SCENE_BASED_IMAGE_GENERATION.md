# Scene-Based Image Generation System

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Automatic scene visualization for roleplay conversations using SDXL Lustify  
**Integration:** AI Playground â†’ Roleplay Mode â†’ Scene Detection â†’ Image Generation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The Scene-Based Image Generation System automatically detects visual scenes in AI roleplay responses and provides one-click generation of optimized SDXL Lustify images that accurately represent the described scene while maintaining character consistency and narrative coherence.

## ðŸ”§ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SceneImageGenerator** (`src/components/playground/SceneImageGenerator.tsx`)
   - Detects scenes in AI responses
   - Provides UI for scene visualization options
   - Integrates with existing generation system

2. **useSceneGeneration** (`src/hooks/useSceneGeneration.ts`)
   - Scene analysis and context extraction
   - SDXL prompt optimization (75-token limit)
   - Character reference integration (planned)

3. **MessageBubble Integration**
   - Automatically appears on AI messages in roleplay mode
   - Only shows when scene content is detected
   - Seamless workflow integration

## ðŸŽ¨ Scene Detection

### Detection Patterns

The system identifies scenes using multiple pattern categories:

**Roleplay Action Patterns:**
- `*actions in asterisks*`
- `(action descriptions)`

**Movement & Positioning:**
- moves, walks, sits, stands, leans, approaches, steps, turns

**Physical Interactions:**
- touches, kisses, embraces, holds, caresses, grabs, pulls

**Environmental Descriptions:**
- "in the", "at the", "on the" + location
- bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, hotel, car, etc.

**Visual Descriptions:**
- wearing, dressed, naked, nude, clothing, outfit, lingerie

**Emotional/Sensual Indicators:**
- passionate, intimate, romantic, seductive, sensual, aroused

## ðŸ“Š Scene Analysis Process

### 1. Character Extraction
```typescript
// From roleplay template
const characters = roleplayTemplate?.characters?.map(char => ({
  name: char.name,
  visualDescription: char.visualDescription || 'attractive person',
  role: char.role
})) || [];
```

### 2. Action Detection
- Extracts actions from asterisks and natural language
- Focuses on visual, physical actions
- Limits to top 3 most relevant actions

### 3. Setting & Environment
- Pattern matching for locations and settings
- Context-aware environment detection
- Default: "intimate indoor setting"

### 4. Mood & Atmosphere
- Emotional tone extraction
- Sensual/romantic context detection
- Influences lighting and atmosphere in prompt

### 5. NSFW Content Classification
- Automatic NSFW detection based on content
- Roleplay template adult flag consideration
- Affects prompt optimization strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ SDXL Lustify Optimization

### Prompt Structure (75 Token Limit)

1. **Quality Tags (12 tokens)** - HIGHEST Priority
   ```
   score_9, score_8_up, masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed
   ```

2. **Character Description (15-20 tokens)**
   ```
   beautiful [character_visual_description]
   ```

3. **NSFW Anatomical Accuracy (if applicable)**
   ```
   perfect anatomy, natural proportions, detailed intimate anatomy
   ```

4. **Scene Context (10-15 tokens)**
   ```
   [mood] [setting] [visual_elements]
   ```

5. **Technical Specifications (remaining tokens)**
   ```
   professional photography, 4K, sharp focus, warm lighting
   ```

### Token Management Strategy

- **Smart prioritization** - Quality tags always included
- **Dynamic allocation** - Adjusts based on content type
- **NSFW optimization** - Enhanced anatomical accuracy for adult content
- **Character focus** - Prioritizes main character visual details
- **Technical excellence** - Professional photography terms for quality

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Automatic Detection
1. User engages in roleplay conversation
2. AI responds with scene description
3. System automatically detects visual scene content
4. Scene generation card appears below AI message

### One-Click Generation
1. User clicks "Generate Scene Image"
2. System analyzes scene context
3. Converts to optimized SDXL prompt
4. Generates image using existing pipeline
5. Image appears in user's library

### Advanced Options
- **Quality Selection:** Fast (~15s) vs High (~45s)
- **Scene Analysis:** Manual scene re-analysis
- **Prompt Preview:** View optimized SDXL prompt
- **Character Context:** Display detected characters and elements

## ðŸŽ­ Roleplay Integration

### Character Consistency
- Uses roleplay template character descriptions
- Maintains visual consistency across scenes
- Preserves character relationships and context

### Narrative Coherence
- Considers conversation history
- Maintains scene continuity
- Respects established setting and mood

### NSFW Content Handling
- Automatic adult content detection
- Preserves explicit terminology
- Optimizes for SDXL Lustify model capabilities
- Respects user content preferences

## ðŸ”® Advanced Features

### Scene Context Preservation
```typescript
interface SceneContext {
  characters: Array<{
    name: string;
    visualDescription: string;
    role: string;
  }>;
  setting: string;
  mood: string;
  actions: string[];
  isNSFW: boolean;
  visualElements: string[];
}
```

### Quality Options
- **Fast Generation:** SDXL Fast (~15 seconds)
- **High Quality:** SDXL High (~45 seconds)
- **Style Options:** Realistic, Artistic, Anime, Lustify (planned)

### Character Reference Integration (Planned)
