### SDXL Worker Startup Fix (Structure and Entry Points)

### Summary

- **Issue**: SDXL worker crashed with `'LustifySDXLWorker' object has no attribute 'run'` during startup under the supervisor/orchestrator.
- **Root cause**: A helper function `upload_to_supabase_storage` was defined outside the `LustifySDXLWorker` class but referenced by in-class methods. This caused the Python parser/AST tools and some supervisors to treat the class as having ended earlier than intended, making later methods (including `run`) appear missing.
- **Fix**:
  - Moved `upload_to_supabase_storage` into the `LustifySDXLWorker` class as an instance method.
  - Ensured internal calls use `self.upload_to_supabase_storage(...)`.
  - Added multiple entry-point aliases (`start`, `serve`, `launch`) delegating to `run` for supervisor compatibility.
  - Kept a clear `main()` entry point and `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.
- **Result**: The class structure is now consistent; supervisors can call any of `run/start/serve/launch` without attribute errors.

---

### Technical Detail

- The orchestrator (`dual_orchestrator.py`) starts workers via subprocess calls to their Python scripts (not by importing classes), but certain environments and tooling (AST checks, auxiliary supervisors) expect the class to expose a callable `run` or alternative entry points.
- Having `upload_to_supabase_storage` at module-level while tightly coupled to class state created ambiguity and made later methods appear outside of the class in some analyses.
- Consolidating that function as a proper instance method resolved scoping/structure concerns and removed ambiguity for downstream tools.

---

### Changes Made

- **Class structure**:
  - Moved `upload_to_supabase_storage(...)` into `LustifySDXLWorker`.
  - Updated internal references to use `self.upload_to_supabase_storage(...)`.
- **Entry points**:
  - Confirmed/retained `run()` as the primary loop.
  - Added `start()`, `serve()`, `launch()` methods that call `self.run()`.
  - Ensured a clean `main()` and `if __name__ == "__main__":` execution block.

---

### Verification

- Parsed the worker file with Python `ast` to confirm `LustifySDXLWorker` now lists all methods, including `run/start/serve/launch`.
- Basic syntax validation succeeded.
- Full runtime verification of SDXL generation requires GPU/PyTorch environment (RunPod). Local Windows checks were limited to structural/syntax tests.

---

### Operational Notes

- Orchestrated startup continues to rely on `dual_orchestrator.py` which spawns workers as subprocesses.
- Supervisors that import the class directly can now safely call any of `worker.run()`, `worker.start()`, `worker.serve()`, or `worker.launch()`.
- No database migrations required. Supabase usage unchanged.

---

### Recommendations

- Keep helper routines that depend on worker state inside the class to avoid scoping ambiguity.
- Maintain a consistent set of entry-point aliases in all workers for supervisor compatibility.
- Add a lightweight CI check that parses worker files with `ast` and asserts presence of required methods.

---

### Impact

- Eliminates startup crashes related to missing `run` attribute.
- Improves compatibility with varied supervisors and orchestration patterns.
- Clarifies worker code structure and reduces risk of future scoping issues.
