## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-06

### 🚨 CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH - WAN 2.1 DEPENDENCIES RESOLVED
- **WAN 2.1**: Now imports successfully after extensive dependency resolution
- **PyTorch Stability**: Maintained 2.4.1+cu124 throughout the process
- **Manual Testing**: Confirmed WAN generates real content (968KB MP4 files)
- **Worker Configuration**: Updated with verified parameters

### 🔧 Dependency Resolution Process (Detailed)
- **Root Cause**: Missing dependencies (`easydict`, `omegaconf`, `diffusers`, `transformers`)
- **Version Conflicts**: Resolved `tokenizers` (>=0.21) and `safetensors` (>=0.4.3)
- **Solution**: Systematic one-by-one installation with `--no-deps` flag
- **Result**: All WAN dependencies working without breaking PyTorch

### 📋 Critical Lessons Learned
- **Never install packages without `--no-deps`** when PyTorch compatibility matters
- **Never install these packages** (they break PyTorch):
  - `torch` (any version different from container)
  - `torchvision` (any version different from container)
  - `accelerate` (has torch dependencies)
  - `timm` (often has torch dependencies)
- **Safe Installation Procedure**: Always test PyTorch version after installation

### 🚨 Dependency Resolution Breakthrough Details
**Previous Problem**: WAN 2.1 failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'easydict'` and multiple dependency conflicts

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. **Clean Contaminated Storage**: Removed packages that broke PyTorch
2. **One-by-One Installation**: Used `--no-deps` flag for each package
3. **Version Conflict Resolution**: Force upgraded specific packages with version requirements
4. **Environment Setup**: Set PYTHONPATH to persistent dependencies

**Verified Working Dependencies**:
```yaml
Safe Dependencies in Persistent Storage:
  easydict: ✅ Available (WAN configuration)
  omegaconf: ✅ Available (YAML config)  
  einops: ✅ Available (tensor operations)
  diffusers: ✅ Available (diffusion models, no torch deps)
  transformers: ✅ Available (language models, no torch deps)
  tokenizers: ✅ v0.21.2 (correct version)
  safetensors: ✅ v0.4.3+ (correct version)
  cv2: ✅ Available (OpenCV)

System Dependencies (Container):
  torch: ✅ 2.4.1+cu124 (NEVER TOUCH)
  torchvision: ✅ 0.16.0+cu124 (stable)
  CUDA libraries: ✅ 12.4 (working)
```

**Manual Generation Test Results**:
```bash
# Test completed successfully:
python generate.py --task t2v-1.3B --ckpt_dir /workspace/models/wan2.1-t2v-1.3b --prompt "girl riding bicycle" --frame_num 17 --size 480*832 --save_file /tmp/test_video.mp4

# Result:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 968933 Jul  5 20:58 /tmp/test_video.mp4
✅ 968KB MP4 file generated successfully
✅ Generation time: ~51 seconds (excellent performance)
✅ Quality: Production-ready video output
```

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-23

### 🚀 Major Improvements & New Features
- **Multi-Reference System (SDXL Only)**: Now supports separate reference images for style, composition, and character. Fully live in the frontend (see MultiReferencePanel).
- **Reference Image Storage Bucket**: Added dedicated Supabase storage bucket for user-uploaded/third-party reference images.
- **Compel Integration (SDXL)**: Compel code is present but not actively used for SDXL due to model incompatibility. SDXL currently uses standard prompt strings. Prompt library for SDXL enhancement is in progress.
- **Qwen 7B Prompt Enhancement**: WAN worker uses Qwen 7B for automatic prompt enhancement. Frontend PromptEnhancementModal leverages Qwen logic for instant, user-selectable prompt enhancement.
- **Edge Functions**: All four edge functions (queue-job, job-callback, enhance-prompt, generate-admin-image) are live and up to date. Enhance-prompt edge function provides rule-based and Qwen-style prompt enhancement.
- **Callback & Queue Standardization**: All edge functions and workers now use standardized callback and job queue parameters (job_id, assets array, compel metadata, etc.).
- **Image-to-Image for SDXL**: SDXL jobs now support image-to-image generation with flexible reference types.

### 🛠️ Other Improvements
- Improved error handling and debugging in edge functions and workers.
- Enhanced metadata tracking for jobs, images, and videos.
- Documentation and codebase alignment for all new features.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
- Compel is not used for SDXL due to Lustify model incompatibility; prompt library enhancement is planned.
- Multi-reference system is only available for SDXL jobs (not WAN).
- Enhanced prompt system for SDXL is in progress.
