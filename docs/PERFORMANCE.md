## **🔧 Performance Optimizations**

### **Model Pre-loading Strategy**
```yaml
Current State:
  - Models loaded on-demand for each job
  - Loading time: 2m 10s for WAN models
  - SDXL loading: ~27s (cached after first load)

Optimization Plan:
  - Pre-load models at worker startup
  - Keep models in memory during session
  - Implement model switching without reloading
  - Expected improvement: 75% reduction in loading time

Implementation:
  - Modify worker startup sequence
  - Add model persistence layer
  - Implement memory management
  - Monitor VRAM usage during pre-loading
```

### **GPU Memory Management**
```yaml
RTX 6000 ADA (48GB VRAM):
  SDXL Worker:
    Model Load: 6.6GB
    Generation Peak: 10.5GB
    Cleanup: 0GB (perfect cleanup)
    
  WAN Worker:
    Model Load: ~15GB
    Generation Peak: 15-30GB
    Qwen Enhancement: 8-12GB (currently disabled)
    
  Concurrent Operation:
    Total Peak: ~35GB
    Available: 13GB headroom
    Strategy: Sequential loading/unloading

Optimization Strategies:
  - Model Loading: Lazy loading only when needed
  - Persistence: All models stored on network volume
  - Caching: Models remain in memory during session
  - Memory Management: Efficient cleanup after processing
```

### **Queue Management Optimizations**
```yaml
Current Configuration:
  sdxl_queue: 2-second polling
  wan_queue: 5-second polling
  Job batching: SDXL generates 6 images per job
  Priority handling: Fast jobs processed first

Optimization Opportunities:
  - Dynamic polling based on queue depth
  - Job prioritization based on user tier
  - Batch processing for similar job types
  - Queue load balancing across workers
```
