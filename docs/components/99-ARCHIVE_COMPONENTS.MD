## Archived Components (to maintain inventory and retire legacy UI)

Note: This list should only include components not used by current pages. Confirm before moving items here.

### Workspace (legacy candidates)
- `src/components/workspace/Workspace.tsx` (legacy page)
- `src/components/workspace/UnifiedReferencePanel.tsx`
- `src/components/workspace/MultiReferencePanel.tsx`
- `src/components/workspace/VideoReferencePanel.tsx`
- `src/components/workspace/CompactReferenceUpload.tsx`

### Library (legacy folder exists)
- `src/components/library/legacy/*` â€” already archived; keep as historical reference only

### Notes
- Prefer extracting shared components rather than duplicating: shared Grid and shared Lightbox should serve both pages.
