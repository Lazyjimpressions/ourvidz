## **🎯 Performance Insights**

### **WAN video_fast Analysis (Established Baseline)**
```yaml
Performance: 262s average (227-297s range)
Bottlenecks:
  - Model Loading: 2m 10s (70% of total time)
  - Generation: 2m 31s (25% of total time)
  - File Operations: 4s (5% of total time)

Optimization Potential:
  - Model pre-loading: 2m → 30s (75% reduction)
  - Total time: 4m 22s → 2m 30s (44% improvement)
```

### **Next Priority Actions**
1. **Test SDXL performance** - Establish baseline for image generation
2. **Implement model pre-loading** - Reduce WAN loading time by 75%
3. **Complete remaining job types** - Systematic testing of all 10 job types

## **📈 Performance Goals**

### **Short-term (1 month)**
- Complete all 10 job type baselines
- Implement model pre-loading optimization
- Achieve 2m 30s WAN video_fast performance

### **Medium-term (3 months)**
- Optimize all job types for production
- Enable Qwen enhancement with good quality
- Achieve >99% job success rate
