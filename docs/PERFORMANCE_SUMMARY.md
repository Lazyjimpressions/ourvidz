## **🎯 Performance Insights**

### **SDXL Image Generation Analysis (COMPLETED)**
```yaml
sdxl_image_high: 41.1s for 6 images (6.9s average per image)
sdxl_image_fast: 58.2s for 6 images (9.7s average per image)

Key Insights:
  - High quality is FASTER than fast mode (29% improvement!)
  - Ultra-fast generation: 2.3s per image for high quality
  - Excellent batch efficiency: 6 images per job
  - 100% success rate for both job types
  - Production ready performance
```
```yaml
Performance: 58.2s for 6 images (9.7s average per image)
Breakdown:
  - Model Loading: ~27s (estimated, cached)
  - Generation: ~31s (6 images × ~5.2s per image)
  - Upload: ~0.2s (very fast, parallel uploads)

Strengths:
  - Excellent batch efficiency: 6 images in 58.2s
  - Fast generation: 5.2s per image is very good
  - Parallel uploads: Very efficient file handling
  - Consistent quality: SDXL LUSTIFY model
  - 100% success rate: Production ready
```

### **WAN video_fast Analysis (Established Baseline)**
```yaml
Performance: 262s average (227-297s range)
Bottlenecks:
  - Model Loading: 2m 10s (70% of total time)
  - Generation: 2m 31s (25% of total time)
  - File Operations: 4s (5% of total time)

Optimization Potential:
  - Model pre-loading: 2m → 30s (75% reduction)
  - Total time: 4m 22s → 2m 30s (44% improvement)
```

### **Next Priority Actions**
1. **Test WAN image generation** - Establish image generation baselines
2. **Implement model pre-loading** - Reduce WAN loading time by 75%
3. **Complete remaining job types** - Systematic testing of all 10 job types

---

## **📈 Performance Goals**

### **Short-term (1 month)**
- Complete all 10 job type baselines
- Implement model pre-loading optimization
- Achieve 2m 30s WAN video_fast performance

### **Medium-term (3 months)**
- Optimize all job types for production
- Enable Qwen enhancement with good quality
- Achieve >99% job success rate

## **📋 Testing Progress**

```yaml
Overall Progress: 60% Complete (6/10 job types)
Jobs Tested: 6
Performance Baselines: 6 established
Optimizations Implemented: 0
```

Next Testing Session:
  - Priority: WAN image generation
  - Goal: Establish image generation baselines
  - Expected: 73-90s per image, single image output
