# Negative Prompt Improvements - Enhanced Anatomical Accuracy

**Last Updated:** July 6, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Enhanced Implementation Deployed  
**Focus:** Addressing Body Deformities and Artifacts

---

## **üéØ Problem Analysis**

### **Issues Identified from Performance Testing**
Based on the video_high performance results showing persistent quality issues:

```yaml
Quality Issues Found:
  - Body part deformities (hands, feet, face)
  - Anatomical artifacts (extra limbs, missing parts)
  - Inconsistent proportions
  - Generation artifacts and glitches
  - Poor anatomical accuracy in NSFW content
```

### **Root Cause**
The original negative prompting was too generic and didn't specifically target the anatomical accuracy issues that WAN 2.1 models struggle with.

  - malformed joints, dislocated joints, broken bones
  - asymmetrical features, uneven proportions, distorted anatomy
```

#### **2. Enhanced Artifact Prevention**
```yaml
Artifact Protection:
  - blurry, pixelated, grainy, noisy

```

#### **4. Enhanced NSFW-Specific Improvements**
```yaml
NSFW Anatomical Accuracy:
  - deformed breasts, deformed nipples, extra breasts, missing breasts
  - deformed genitals, extra genitals, missing genitals
  - inappropriate anatomy, wrong anatomy, anatomical errors
  - body part deformities, anatomical deformities
  - distorted bodies, unnatural poses, impossible anatomy
  - merged bodies, conjoined, fused limbs
  - wrong proportions, size mismatch, scale errors
```

#### **5. Video-Specific Quality Improvements**
```yaml
Video Artifact Prevention:
  - motion artifacts, temporal inconsistency, frame stuttering
  - object morphing, identity changes, face swapping
  - lighting jumps, exposure changes, color bleeding
  - static, frozen, glitchy, artifacts, frame drops

## **üìä Implementation by Job Type**

### **SDXL Jobs (Token-Optimized)**
```yaml
Strategy: Token-efficient protection (under 77 tokens)
Coverage: Critical negatives + limited anatomical (4/7 categories)
Artifacts: Basic prevention (3/5 categories)
NSFW: Prioritized improvements (6 most critical issues)
Result: Optimized for SDXL's token limitations
```

### **WAN Video Jobs (Comprehensive + Video-Specific)**
```yaml
Strategy: Full protection + enhanced video quality
Coverage: Complete anatomical protection (7/7 categories)
Artifacts: Full prevention + video-specific artifacts
NSFW: Full NSFW protection (all categories)
Video Quality: Motion artifacts, temporal consistency, lighting stability
Result: Maximum protection for video quality with temporal stability
```

### **WAN Image Jobs (Balanced + Prioritized)**
```yaml
Strategy: Balanced protection with priority-based approach
Coverage: Critical + most anatomical issues (6/7 categories)
Artifacts: Enhanced prevention (4/5 categories)
NSFW: Prioritized improvements (8 most critical issues)
Result: Better than SDXL, optimized for image quality
```

## **üéØ Expected Quality Improvements**

### **Anatomical Accuracy**
```yaml
Before Enhancement:
  - Generic "bad anatomy" prompts
  - Limited body part specificity
  - No NSFW anatomical focus

After Enhancement:
  - Specific anatomical targeting
  - Comprehensive body part coverage
  - NSFW-specific anatomical improvements
  - Joint and proportion protection
```

### **Artifact Reduction**
```yaml
Before Enhancement:
  - Basic "blurry, distorted" prompts
  - Limited artifact categories

After Enhancement:
  - Comprehensive artifact prevention
  - Technical artifact targeting
  - Lighting and focus improvements
  - Model-specific artifact handling
```

## **üìà Performance Impact**

### **Expected Benefits (Fine-Tuned)**
```yaml
Quality Improvements:
  - 75% reduction in anatomical errors (target)
  - 60% improvement in body part accuracy for NSFW content
  - 50% fewer artifact issues in videos
  - Better consistency across video frames
  - Enhanced temporal stability in videos
  - Improved lighting consistency

Trade-offs:
  - Optimized token usage for SDXL (under 77 tokens)
  - Priority-based approach reduces over-constraining
  - Video-specific improvements may add 1-3% generation time
  - Enhanced NSFW protection for better anatomical accuracy
```

### **Monitoring Metrics**
```yaml
Success Indicators:
  - Reduced user complaints about deformities
  - Higher quality scores in testing
  - Fewer regeneration requests
  - Better NSFW content quality
  - Improved overall user satisfaction
```
