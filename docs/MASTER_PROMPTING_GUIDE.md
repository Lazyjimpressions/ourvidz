## **üéØ Advanced Token Management**

### **Master Token Optimization Strategy**

```typescript
// Advanced token counting with priority preservation
function masterTokenOptimization(prompt: string, maxTokens: number, jobType: string): string {
  // More accurate token estimation
  function estimateTokens(text: string): number {
    // English: ~4 characters per token
    // Chinese: ~2 characters per token
    const hasChinese = /[\u4e00-\u9fff]/.test(text);
    const ratio = hasChinese ? 2 : 4;
    return Math.ceil(text.length / ratio);
  }
  
  const estimated = estimateTokens(prompt);
  
  if (estimated <= maxTokens) {
    return prompt;
  }
  
  // Priority-based truncation
  const parts = prompt.split(',').map(p => p.trim());
  const priorities = {
    sdxl: ['score_9', 'score_8_up', 'masterpiece', 'best quality', 'highly detailed'],
    wan: ['subject', 'motion', 'environment', 'camera', 'quality']
  };
  
  const jobPriorities = jobType.includes('sdxl') ? priorities.sdxl : priorities.wan;
  const optimized = [];
  
  // Keep priority elements first
  for (const priority of jobPriorities) {
    const matchingParts = parts.filter(p => p.toLowerCase().includes(priority.toLowerCase()));
    optimized.push(...matchingParts);
  }
  
  // Add remaining parts until token limit
  for (const part of parts) {
    if (!optimized.includes(part) && estimateTokens(optimized.join(', ')) < maxTokens - 10) {
      optimized.push(part);
    }
  }
  
  return optimized.join(', ');
}
