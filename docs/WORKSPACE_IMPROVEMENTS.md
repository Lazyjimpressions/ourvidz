# Workspace Performance Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the workspace components to address performance issues and user experience concerns.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Excessive Storage Requests
**Problem**: The workspace was making individual signed URL requests for each image/video on every page load, causing:
- Slow loading times
- Excessive API calls to Supabase storage
- Poor user experience with repeated requests

**Solution**: Implemented session-based URL caching using `sessionStorage`

### 2. Workspace Session Management
**Problem**: Workspace was persisting content across browser sessions, but users wanted:
- Clean workspace on new sessions
- Session-based workspace state
- Proper user isolation

**Solution**: Enhanced session management with user-specific session tracking

## Technical Improvements

### Session-Based URL Caching

#### Before
```typescript
// Each image triggered individual storage request
for (const path of imageUrls) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .storage
    .from(bucket)
    .createSignedUrl(path, 3600);
}
```

#### After
```typescript
// Cache URLs in sessionStorage to avoid repeated requests
const sessionCache = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('signed_urls') || '{}');
const key = `${bucket}|${path}`;

if (sessionCache[key]) {
  result[path] = sessionCache[key]; // Use cached URL
} else {
  // Only request if not cached
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .storage
    .from(bucket)
    .createSignedUrl(path, 3600);
  
  if (data?.signedUrl) {
    sessionCache[key] = data.signedUrl; // Cache for future use
  }
}
```

### Benefits of URL Caching

1. **Reduced API Calls**: URLs are cached for the session duration (1 hour)
2. **Faster Loading**: Subsequent page loads use cached URLs
3. **Better UX**: Images load instantly from cache
4. **Cost Optimization**: Fewer storage API requests

### Session Management Improvements

#### WorkspaceTest Component
- **New Session Detection**: Automatically detects new sessions and starts with empty workspace
- **User Isolation**: Each user gets their own session workspace
- **Session Persistence**: Workspace content persists within the same session
- **Clean State**: Fresh start on new browser sessions

#### Main Workspace Component
- **Enhanced Session Tracking**: Better user and session identification
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old session data is automatically cleared
- **24-Hour Limit**: Session data expires after 24 hours

## Components Updated

### 1. TestMediaGrid.tsx
- ✅ Implemented session-based URL caching
- ✅ Parallel URL processing with `Promise.all`
- ✅ Image preloading for better UX
- ✅ Simplified interface while maintaining functionality
- ✅ Reduced from ~200 lines to ~80 lines

### 2. TestVideoGrid.tsx
- ✅ Implemented session-based URL caching
- ✅ Parallel video URL processing
- ✅ Simplified bucket inference logic
- ✅ Consistent caching strategy with TestMediaGrid

### 3. WorkspaceTest.tsx
- ✅ Enhanced session management
- ✅ New session detection and cleanup
- ✅ User-specific workspace isolation
- ✅ Debug utilities for testing

### 4. utils.ts
- ✅ Added utility functions for session management
- ✅ `clearWorkspaceSessionData()` - Clear all workspace data
- ✅ `clearSignedUrlCache()` - Clear only URL cache
- ✅ `getSessionStorageStats()` - Monitor storage usage

## Performance Impact

### Before Improvements
- **Storage Requests**: 1 request per image/video per page load
- **Loading Time**: Slow due to sequential requests
- **User Experience**: Repeated loading states
- **API Usage**: High due to repeated requests

### After Improvements
- **Storage Requests**: 1 request per image/video per session
- **Loading Time**: Fast after initial load
- **User Experience**: Instant loading from cache
- **API Usage**: Significantly reduced

## Usage Examples

### Clearing Session Data (Debug)
```typescript
import { clearWorkspaceSessionData } from '@/lib/utils';

// Clear all workspace session data
clearWorkspaceSessionData();
```

### Monitoring Storage Usage
```typescript
import { getSessionStorageStats } from '@/lib/utils';

// Get current storage statistics
const stats = getSessionStorageStats();
console.log('Storage usage:', stats);
```

### Clearing URL Cache Only
```typescript
import { clearSignedUrlCache } from '@/lib/utils';

// Force fresh URL requests
clearSignedUrlCache();
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **New Session Test**
   - Open browser in incognito mode
   - Navigate to workspace
   - Verify workspace is empty
   - Import some assets
   - Refresh page
   - Verify assets persist
   - Close browser and reopen
   - Verify workspace is empty again

2. **URL Caching Test**
   - Load workspace with images
   - Note the loading time
   - Refresh page
   - Verify images load instantly (no loading states)
   - Check browser network tab for reduced requests

3. **User Isolation Test**
   - Login as User A
   - Add assets to workspace
   - Logout and login as User B
   - Verify workspace is empty
   - Add different assets
   - Switch back to User A
   - Verify original assets are restored

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Persistent Workspace**: Option to save workspace across sessions
2. **Workspace Templates**: Pre-defined workspace configurations
3. **Advanced Caching**: Implement LRU cache for better memory management
4. **Background Preloading**: Preload assets in background
5. **Compression**: Compress cached URLs to reduce storage usage

### Monitoring

- Track cache hit rates
- Monitor storage usage patterns
- Measure performance improvements
- User feedback on workspace experience

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the workspace performance and user experience by:

1. **Reducing API calls** through intelligent caching
2. **Improving loading times** with session-based caching
3. **Enhancing user experience** with proper session management
4. **Providing debugging tools** for development and testing

The workspace now provides a smooth, fast experience while maintaining the flexibility to start fresh on new sessions as requested by users.
