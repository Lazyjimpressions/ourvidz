**Phase 1: Generate Base Character Image**
1. **Navigate to Workspace** (`/workspace?mode=image`)
2. **Enter base prompt**: `"beautiful girl in red dress, photorealistic, professional portrait"`
3. **Set optimal settings**:
   - Quality: `High` (for better character details)
   - Model: `SDXL High` (automatic based on quality)
   - Quantity: `4 images` (gives options to user)
4. **Generate** and wait for completion
5. **Review results** and select best character image

**Phase 2: Set Up Character Reference**
1. **Drag selected image** from workspace to **Character** reference slot in MultiReferencePanel
2. **Configure reference settings**:
   - Reference Type: `Character` ‚úÖ (automatically selected)
   - Reference Strength: `0.7` ‚úÖ (optimal for face consistency)
   - Reference Source: `Workspace` ‚úÖ (shows workspace badge)

**Phase 3: Generate Character Transformation**
1. **Enter transformation prompt**: `"beautiful girl in bathing suit, same person, same facial features, beach background"`
2. **System auto-optimization**:
   - Quality automatically upgraded to `High` for character consistency
   - Model: `SDXL High` (forced for character references)
   - Quantity: `4-6 images` (provides options)
3. **Enhanced generation metadata**:
   ```json
   {
     "reference_type": "character",
     "reference_strength": 0.7,
     "character_consistency": true,
     "reference_source": "workspace",
     "model_variant": "lustify_sdxl"
   }
   ```
4. **Generate** and compare results

#### **Technical Implementation Details**

**Automatic Quality Upgrades**
- When character reference is detected ‚Üí Force `sdxl_image_high`
- Character consistency requires higher model quality
- User sees quality upgrade notification

**Optimal Reference Settings**
```typescript
const characterReferenceConfig = {
  type: 'character',
  strength: 0.7,           // Strong enough for face consistency
  model: 'sdxl_image_high', // Better for character consistency
  numImages: 4,            // Gives user options
  enhancedPrompt: true     // Auto-adds "same person, same facial features"
};
```

**Prompt Enhancement**
- Original: `"beautiful girl in bathing suit"`
- Enhanced: `"beautiful girl in bathing suit, same person, same facial features"`
- System automatically adds character consistency terms

**Expected Results**
- ‚úÖ **Face consistency**: Same facial features and structure
- ‚úÖ **Style flexibility**: Different clothing (red dress ‚Üí bathing suit)
- ‚úÖ **Background adaptability**: Can change environments
- ‚úÖ **Expression variations**: Different poses/expressions with same character

### **WAN Video Reference Frames Workflow**

#### **"Starting Image ‚Üí Video Sequence" Use Case**

**Phase 1: Generate Base Reference Image**
1. **Navigate to Workspace** (`/workspace?mode=image`)
2. **Enter base prompt**: `"beautiful woman in elegant pose, cinematic lighting, professional portrait"`
3. **Set optimal settings**:
   - Quality: `High` (for better reference quality)
   - Model: `SDXL High` (for detailed reference)
   - Quantity: `1-2 images` (select best reference)
4. **Generate** and select the best reference image

**Phase 2: Set Up Video Reference Frame**
1. **Navigate to Workspace** (`/workspace?mode=video`)
2. **Drag selected image** to **Starting Point** reference slot in VideoReferencePanel
3. **Configure reference settings**:
   - Reference Type: `Character` ‚úÖ (automatically selected for video)
   - Reference Strength: `0.85` ‚úÖ (optimal for video consistency)
   - Reference Source: `Workspace` ‚úÖ (shows workspace badge)

**Phase 3: Generate Video with Reference**
1. **Enter video prompt**: `"beautiful woman walking gracefully, smooth motion, cinematic atmosphere"`
2. **System configuration**:
   - Model: `WAN Fast` or `WAN High` (automatic based on quality)
   - Reference frame: Start frame from selected image
   - Duration: 5 seconds (83 frames at 16.67fps)
3. **Enhanced generation metadata**:
   ```json
   {
     "reference_type": "character",
     "reference_strength": 0.85,
     "start_reference_url": "workspace_image_url",
     "start_reference_source": "workspace",
     "model_variant": "wan_2_1_1_3b"
   }
   ```
4. **Generate** and review video sequence

#### **Technical Implementation Details**

**WAN Reference Strength Control**
The WAN 1.3B model uses `--first_frame` parameter for reference frames, but doesn't have built-in strength control. The worker implements reference strength by adjusting the `sample_guide_scale` parameter:

```python
# Reference strength affects guidance scale
# 0.1 strength = 5.0 guidance (minimal reference influence)
# 0.5 strength = 7.0 guidance (moderate reference influence)  
# 0.9 strength = 8.6 guidance (strong reference influence)
# 1.0 strength = 9.0 guidance (maximum reference influence)
```

**Optimal Video Reference Settings**
```typescript
const videoReferenceConfig = {
  type: 'character',
  strength: 0.85,          // Strong enough for video consistency
  model: 'video_fast',     // 25 steps, 135s generation time
  frameCount: 83,          // 5 seconds at 16.67fps
  referenceFrame: 'start'  // Use as starting frame
};
```

**Video Generation Process**
1. **Reference Processing**: Download and resize reference image to 480x832
2. **Command Construction**: Build WAN command with `--first_frame` parameter
3. **Strength Adjustment**: Modify `sample_guide_scale` based on reference strength
4. **Video Generation**: Execute T2V task with reference frame influence

**Expected Results**
- ‚úÖ **Starting frame consistency**: Video begins with reference image
- ‚úÖ **Character continuity**: Same person throughout video sequence
- ‚úÖ **Motion quality**: Smooth transitions from reference pose
- ‚úÖ **Temporal stability**: Consistent lighting and style

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**

#### **SDXL Character Reference**
- [ ] Character reference shows "Workspace" badge
- [ ] Reference strength set to 0.7
- [ ] Quality automatically upgraded to "High"
- [ ] Model shows "SDXL High"
- [ ] Prompt includes character consistency terms
- [ ] Generated images maintain facial consistency
- [ ] New outfit/setting successfully applied

#### **WAN Video Reference**
- [ ] Video reference shows "Workspace" badge
- [ ] Reference strength set to 0.85
- [ ] Starting frame matches reference image
- [ ] Video maintains character consistency
- [ ] Motion flows naturally from reference pose
- [ ] No flickering or temporal artifacts

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **SDXL Character Reference Issues**
**Problem**: Generated images don't look like reference character
- **Solution**: Increase reference strength to 0.8-0.9

**Problem**: Generated images too similar to reference (same dress)
- **Solution**: Decrease reference strength to 0.5-0.6, enhance prompt specificity

**Problem**: Poor quality results
- **Solution**: Ensure SDXL High model is selected, increase num_images to 6

#### **WAN Video Reference Issues**
**Problem**: Video doesn't start with reference image
- **Solution**: Ensure reference strength is 0.8-0.9, check reference image quality

**Problem**: Video loses character consistency
- **Solution**: Increase reference strength to 0.9-1.0, use higher quality reference

**Problem**: Video too similar to reference (no motion)
- **Solution**: Decrease reference strength to 0.7-0.8, enhance motion in prompt

**Problem**: Poor video quality
- **Solution**: Use WAN High model, ensure reference image is high quality

## **Qwen-Only Prompt Enhancement (2025+)**

- All prompt enhancement is now performed by Qwen (LLM) with user review and editing.
- Compel weighting is deprecated and not supported for any model.
- All prompt analytics, scoring, and A/B testing should use the following Supabase tables:
  - model_test_results
  - job_enhancement_analysis
  - image_enhancement_analysis
  - video_enhancement_analysis
  - prompt_ab_tests
- Use the following fields for Qwen analytics: original_prompt, enhanced_prompt, enhancement_strategy, qwen_expansion_percentage, quality_rating, notes, etc.

### **Best Practices for NSFW, Positions, Multi-Party Prompts**
- Use explicit, clear language in the base prompt (e.g., "three women and one man in group scene").
- Let Qwen expand and professionalize the description.
- For positions, use anatomical terms and clear action verbs (e.g., "woman straddling man").
- For NSFW, use professional, explicit language; Qwen will refine and expand.
- Always review the Qwen-enhanced prompt for token safety and clarity.
- Rate and record anatomical accuracy, realism, and quality in Supabase.
