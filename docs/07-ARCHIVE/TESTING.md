2. Progress to explicit tier for content testing
3. Test unrestricted tier for model limits
4. Rate quality immediately after generation
5. Add detailed notes for future reference

### **For Batch Testing**
1. Select comprehensive series coverage
2. Start with fewer variations (1-3) for initial testing
3. Increase variations (5-10) for detailed analysis
4. Monitor progress and resource usage
5. Review all results systematically

### **For Quality Assessment**
1. Use consistent rating criteria
2. Consider model-specific strengths
3. Document exceptional results
4. Track quality trends over time
5. Use analytics for optimization

This comprehensive testing framework ensures systematic evaluation and baseline maintenance for all AI models in the system, providing reliable quality assessment and performance monitoring capabilities. 

## **Qwen-Only Prompt Testing & Scoring**

- All prompt testing, scoring, and analytics are now Qwen-based.
- Use the following Supabase tables for all analytics and dashboards:
  - model_test_results
  - job_enhancement_analysis
  - image_enhancement_analysis
  - video_enhancement_analysis
  - prompt_ab_tests
- Use the following fields for Qwen analytics: prompt_text, enhanced_prompt, overall_quality, technical_quality, content_quality, consistency, notes, enhancement_strategy, qwen_expansion_percentage, etc.

### **Best Practices for NSFW, Positions, Multi-Party Prompts**
- Use explicit, clear language in the base prompt.
- Let Qwen expand and professionalize the description.
- For multi-party, specify all participants and desired interactions in the prompt.
- For positions, use anatomical terms and clear action verbs.
- For NSFW, use professional, explicit language; Qwen will refine and expand.
- Always review the Qwen-enhanced prompt for token safety and clarity.
- Rate and record anatomical accuracy, realism, and quality in Supabase.
