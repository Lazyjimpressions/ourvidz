## Basic Usage Examples

### Example 1: Progressive NSFW Sequence

The AI should provide:
- 4 structured prompts with progressive escalation
- Appropriate negative prompts for each scene
- Token optimization suggestions
- Quality modifiers for SDXL
- Scene progression guidance

**Example AI Response:**
```
I'll help you create a 4-image progressive sequence for SDXL. Here are optimized prompts:

**Scene 1 - Introduction:**
A handsome man and beautiful woman, meeting at an elegant bar, casual conversation, warm ambient lighting, professional photography, 8k, highly detailed, (blurry, low quality, distorted:1.2)

**Scene 2 - Flirting:**
The same couple, sitting closer together, flirting and touching hands, intimate lighting, soft focus, 8k, highly detailed, (blurry, low quality:1.2)

**Scene 3 - Kissing:**
The couple, passionately kissing, in a private corner, romantic lighting, cinematic composition, 8k, highly detailed, (blurry, low quality:1.2)

**Scene 4 - Intimate:**
The couple, undressing each other, in a dimly lit bedroom, sensual lighting, 8k, highly detailed, (blurry, low quality, distorted:1.2)

**Key Considerations:**
- Maintain character consistency across all scenes
- Progressive intensity escalation
- Consistent lighting and setting themes
- Token count: ~75-100 per prompt (optimal for SDXL)
```
