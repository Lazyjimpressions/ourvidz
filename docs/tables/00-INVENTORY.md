# Supabase Tables â€“ Inventory Snapshot (public)

This snapshot is generated by running the single-command inventory in `docs/tables/01-INVENTORY_SQL.md` in the Supabase SQL editor. It lists each base table in `public` with columns, primary key, foreign keys, unique and check constraints, and indexes.

Note: Update this file by re-running the SQL and reformatting the JSON output into the sections below.

For the current snapshot of all tables, see this file (kept as the source of truth) and use `docs/tables/README.md` as a navigation index.
